<b># WanderLust Project</b>

<b>Project Summary:</b>

I have successfully designed and implemented a full-stack Airbnb clone, which replicates the core functionality of the Airbnb platform. This project encompasses various components, including a user-friendly front-end interface, a dynamic back-end server, and a robust database system and also implemented Map API features to locate the rental homes with MVC Framework. Below are the key features and technologies used in this Airbnb clone:

<b>Front-end:</b>
1. Developed a responsive web application using modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. Implemented a user-friendly interface for searching and listing properties.
3. Utilized frameworks such as React.js for building dynamic and interactive user experiences.
4. Integrated Google Maps API for location-based search and property mapping.

<b>Back-end:</b>
1. Built a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js to handle user interactions.
2. Implemented user authentication and authorization using technologies like JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
3. Created endpoints for property listing, login/sign up and user management.


<b>Database:</b>
1. Utilized a relational database management system MongoDB for storing property and user data.
2. Designed a well-structured database schema for efficient data management.
3. Employed database queries to retrieve and store property and user information.

<b>Additional Features:</b>
1. Implemented a search and filter system for property listings.
2. Included features for user reviews, ratings, and messaging between users.
3. Ensured security and data privacy through encryption and data validation.
4. Deployed the web application on a cloud platform on Cloudinary to make it accessible online.


The Airbnb clone project showcases my proficiency in full-stack web development, from creating an engaging front-end to managing the back-end and database components. It allows users to search for properties and experience the key functionalities of the Airbnb platform in a seamless and secure manner.
